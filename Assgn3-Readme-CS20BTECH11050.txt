Instructions:

Input in file named "inp-params.txt" should be in the following format:

 1) Number of processes (N)
 2) N lines of input where each line contains input in the following format
    "Process id <space> Processing time <space> Period <space> Number of times each process repeats"
 3) Example:
    2
    1 20 50 2
    2 35 100 2

For Linux Operating Systems:

 1) Go to the folder containing the code file and run the following commands in Linux terminal
      command1: $g++ Assgn3RMS-CS20BTECH11050.cpp
      command2:$./a.out

      command1: $g++ Assgn3EDF-CS20BTECH11050.cpp
      command2:$./a.out
    
    To name the output file run the following commands
      command1: $g++ -o <name of output> Assgn3RMS-CS20BTECH11050.cpp
      command2:$./<name of output> 

      command1: $g++ -o <name of output> Assgn3EDF-CS20BTECH11050.cpp
      command2:$./<name of output> 

    Note:"$" in commands above is just for linux terminal reference
         Do not use spaces or any symbols (except underscore(_)) in <name of output>

  2) Output Format:
     1) RMS-Log.txt and RM-Stats.txt files are obtained after compiling Assgn3RMS-CS20BTECH11050.cpp
     2) EDF-Log.txt and EDF-Stats.txt files are obtained after compiling Assgn3EDF-CS20BTECH11050.cpp

 
For Other Operating Systems:

 1) Use any IDE which has inbuilt linux libraries and use same commands as above

 2) You can also use the following online IDEs which uses Ubuntu(Linux)
      https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler
      https://replit.com/~
    You can upload the source code in any of the above online IDEs 
    and run directly or you can also use the above commands to run your file
